### Hi there 👋
I'm currently working as a Software Engineer at the [MoMo E-wallet](https://momo.vn/) company.

My primary responsibilities involve building infrastructure for ML models and applying software engineering best practices to our ML services. \
Occasionally, I also delve into modeling tasks, such as creating recommendation services and user-friendly scoring systems.


🏷 Fun fact: I **do** use Emacs over Vim :).
